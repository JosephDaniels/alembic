Introduction
============

We'll start by targeting the thing you'd most often want to do - write and read
animated, geometric primitives. To do this, we will be using two main
modules: :doc:`alembic.Abc </alembic/abc>`, which provides the basic Alembic Abstractions,
and :doc:`alembic.AbcG </alembic/abcg>`, which implements specific Geometric primitives
on top of alembic.Abc.
