:mod:`alembic` -- Alembic Python Bindings Documentation
=======================================================

This module provides Python bindings for `Alembic <http://alembic.io>`_, the 
open computer graphics interchange framework.


Introduction
============

Alembic distills complex, animated scenes into a non-procedural, application-independent 
set of baked geometric results. This â€˜distillation' of scenes into baked geometry is 
exactly analogous to the distillation of lighting and rendering scenes into rendered 
image data.

For more information about Alembic, please visit the Alembic website at 
http://alembic.io.
