:mod:`alembic` -- Alembic Python Bindings Documentation
=======================================================

Alembic is an open source geometry caching format that promotes interoperability
between authoring tools. From `alembic.io <http://alembic.io>`_:

*Alembic distills complex, animated scenes into a non-procedural, application-independent 
set of baked geometric results. This â€˜distillation' of scenes into baked geometry is 
exactly analogous to the distillation of lighting and rendering scenes into rendered 
image data.*

This module provides Python bindings for Alembic.


Getting Started
---------------

The Alembic Python bindings have been tested with 
`Python 2.6 <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.8/>`_, 
and require `PyImath <http://github.com/openexr/openexr>`_ and 
`Boost::Python <http://boost.org>`_ libraries to run. 
In order to use Alembic in Python, you must first build both Alembic and the Alembic 
Python bindings using the bootstrap script: `build/bootstrap/alembic_bootstrap.py`.

**Usage Examples**: Some basic Alembic tasks are explored here.
