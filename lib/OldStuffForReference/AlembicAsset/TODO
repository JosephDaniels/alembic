Big changes:

Property metadata
Property groups - what is a property group? An iterateable collection of properties.

Maybe first-class support for two different bounding boxes: one that is just the
object itself, the other is the object + all its children?

The fullPathName() method for classes extending IBase should return the Alembic
path, not the HDF5 path (see examples of doing so in
AlembicRiPlugin/Instancer.cpp).
